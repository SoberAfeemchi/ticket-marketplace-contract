# Smart Contract Ticket Marketplace

## 📄 Project Description

This project provides the foundational smart contract for a decentralized ticket marketplace on the Stacks blockchain. It includes the core logic for an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) that represents a unique event ticket. The contract allows for the initial creation (minting) of tickets to a specific owner and enables the secure, peer-to-peer transfer of these tickets between different users.

## ራ Project Vision

The vision is to create a transparent, secure, and fair ticketing system powered by blockchain technology. By representing each ticket as a unique NFT, we can eliminate common industry problems such as ticket fraud, counterfeiting, and opaque pricing. This model empowers event creators and attendees by giving them full control and verifiable ownership of their assets in an open marketplace.

## 🚀 Future Scope

This initial contract serves as the core building block. Future development can expand upon this foundation with several key features:

* **Marketplace Contract:** Develop a second smart contract to handle the buying and selling of tickets. This would include functions for listing a ticket for sale at a set price, delisting it, and purchasing it.
* **Royalty Fees:** Implement a royalty mechanism to ensure that the original event creator receives a percentage of the sale price on all secondary market transactions.
* **Event Management:** Allow verified event creators to mint their own series of tickets, manage event details, and control minting permissions.
* **Front-End Integration:** Build a web-based user interface (UI) to interact with the smart contracts, allowing users to easily mint, view, and trade their ticket NFTs.
* **Metadata Integration:** Enhance the NFT to point to dynamic metadata, allowing ticket details (like seat numbers or event dates) to be displayed in wallets and marketplaces.
